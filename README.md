Get started

1. Download and add files, your data to one folder.
2. Start with file: cleanAnalysis.mat
	* Many parts of the code are commented, uncomment it and apply whenever it's suitable
3. pullData.m – function to separate Complete dataset into smaller ones; separate prediction column and save predictor list
4. fsMethods.m – function to try different feature selection methods and choose relevant to your data
5. dataPartition.m – function to partition data into training and test
6. classSvm.m – function to create SVM classifier
7. calculateTrainAccuracy.m – function to preform cross-validation and calculate training accuracy
8. calculateFscore.m – function to calculate fscore value on test data


Enjoy!
